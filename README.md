# prometheus-data-exporter
The Prometheus Data Exporter project allows for customizable datasets to be exported from Prometheus to Excel (csv) form.  Analysis and comparisons on the data is also optionally performed, highlighting key areas of the data.  This enables performance and scale metrics to be historically saved off and run to run analysis and regressions performed.
